HELPDESK START:
We will also have a helpdesk document where you can document any problems you are facing. Once you document any issues you are facing,
and any leads do not contact you to help you, please feel free to contact either Magiber or Holden for support. The reason we need it documented first
If anyone else is facing the same issue, we can document a solution to that problem, and others will be able to reference it if they need to. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


RESOURCES START:

We will also have a dedicated page of resources and links to helpful videos and sites for any specific needs. Some of these recourses will include Programming in C#, Using Unity, and Using Github. These are just general examples but there will be resources for more specific matters. 

If there are any resources that you found that you believe will be beneficial to add to the resources page, please contact either Magiber or Holden about it, and they will make sure it gets added.
