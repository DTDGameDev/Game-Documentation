            (your full name so we know who to contact about the problem), (Where the problem is, for example with Unity or Github),
            (description of the problem, for example My branch on Unity doesn't want to update with the main branch), and (steps to
            reach the problem, for example I just finished my task which took me two weeks, and tried to push it onto the main branch
            but it keeps giving me errors, something about conflicting files?)
        </p>

        <p>Here is a full example:</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Issue #1:</strong> Magiber Aparicio: Github desktop, I am trying to merge my branch to the main branch but it keeps telling
            me I have conflicting files, I just finished my task which took me two weeks to complete, and I don't know why I have
            conflicting files, I didn't change any files that were already on there. I just added a few models and changed some settings.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Solution to Issue #1:</strong> It looks like by the time you finished your task, there had been notable changes to the main
            branch, so much so that the files you didn't change on your branch were already changed in the main branch, hence the
            conflicting files. It is important to always update your branch by merging the main branch into the one you are working
            on whenever the main branch gets updates so that there won't be any conflicting files when you merge your branch back
            into the main one. We resolved this issue by discarding your conflicting files and keeping the files on the main branch
            while still merging the work you had on your branch onto the main branch. Please remember to always update your branch.
